/home/ajay/miniconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sklearn/ensemble/gradient_boosting.py:34: DeprecationWarning: `np.bool` is a deprecated alias for the builtin `bool`. To silence this warning, use `bool` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. If you specifically wanted the numpy scalar type, use `np.bool_` here.
